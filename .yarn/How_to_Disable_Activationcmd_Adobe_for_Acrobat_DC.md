## Method 1: Using the customization wizard
 
The customization wizard is a tool that allows you to customize the installation of Acrobat DC. You can use it to input your serial number and grant an offline exception, which will disable Activationcmd Adobe for your software. Here are the steps to follow:

2. Launch the customization wizard and open the Acrobat DC installer package.
3. Go to Personalization Options and enter your serial number.
4. Go to Online and Acrobat.com Features and check the box for "Grant Offline Exception".
5. Save the package and exit the customization wizard.
6. Install Acrobat DC using the customized package.
7. You should not be prompted to sign in to activate your software.

## Method 2: Editing the hosts file
 
The hosts file is a file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. You can edit it to block Activationcmd Adobe from contacting Adobe servers. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open Notepad as administrator.
2. Go to File > Open and navigate to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc.
3. Select "All Files" from the drop-down menu and open the hosts file.
4. Add the following lines at the bottom of the file:

        # Adobe Blocker
        127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
        127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
        127.0.0.1 lmlicenses.wip4.adobe.com
        127.0.0.1 lm.licenses.adobe.com

5. Save and close the file.
6. Install Acrobat DC normally and enter your serial number when prompted.
7. You should not be prompted to sign in to activate your software.

Note: This method may not work for some versions of Acrobat DC or Windows. It may also affect other Adobe products that require activation. Use it at your own risk.
